 ## Naive Bayes
 ---------------------------
 
 Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

 ## Support Vector Machines
 -----------------------------------
 A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for either of two categories, they’re able to categorize new examples.

 ## K- Nearest Algorithm
 ------------------------------------
 
 KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry.
